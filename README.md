# Storefront Backend Project

## About
This is a functional backend for an e-commerce website. Written in TypeScript, this backend communicates with a PSQL server to keep track of user accounts, their active orders and current stock available on the site. In addition, it also authenticates user actions, hashes password and validates tokens.

## Installation

```
npm install
yarn
```
Make sure that you have both Node and Yarn installed on your system. 

To run the server, simply run
```
yarn watch
```
This will run on port 3000. To access on a browser, simply input localhost:3000 to confirm the server is running.
